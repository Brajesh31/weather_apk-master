## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (v3.0.0 or higher)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter plugins
- An emulator or a physical Android device

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Brajesh31/weather_apk-master.git](https://github.com/Brajesh31/weather_apk-master.git)
cd weather_apk-master
2. Get an API Key
This app requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap to function.

Go to OpenWeatherMap and create a free account.

Navigate to the "API keys" tab and generate a new key.

Copy your API key.

3. Configure the API Key
Create a file to store your secret API key.

In the lib directory, create a new file named api_key.dart.

Add the following content to the file, replacing "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual key:

Dart

// lib/api_key.dart

const String openWeatherAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
Note: This file is included in .gitignore to prevent your secret key from being committed to the repository.

4. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal to fetch all the required packages.

Bash

flutter pub get
5. Run the Application
Connect your device or start your emulator and run the following command.

Bash

flutter run
The app should now build and run on your selected device.
